###The Bamazon Storefront
The Bamazon Storefront is a lot like Amazon. 
This app takes in orders from customers and deplete's stock from the store's inventory.

### Dependencies
This application takes in mysql, node js, and inquirer. 

### How it works
Using inquirer, in the terminal, the user is prompted with what product id they are searching for. When entered, the application asks how many units the user would like to buy.
If there is enough in stock, the user will sucessfully fill out the order.
The application takes away how many units the user wants in their order.
